### **4. `LICENSE` File**

Choose an open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL). Create a `LICENSE` file at the root of your repository with the text of the chosen license. The MIT License is a popular and permissive choice.

### **5. Publishing to GitHub Marketplace**

Once you have your `action.yml`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` in your public repository:

1.  **Commit and Push:** Push all these files to your `main` branch.
2.  **Create a Release:**
    * Go to your action's repository on GitHub.
    * Click on the **"Releases"** tab (often found on the right sidebar or under the "Code" tab).
    * Click **"Create a new release"** (or "Draft a new release").
    * **Choose a new tag:** This is your action's version. Use Semantic Versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1`). For the first release, `v1` is a good start.
    * **Release title:** A descriptive title for this version (e.g., "Initial Release of File Archiver").
    * **Description:** Briefly summarize the changes in this version.
    * **Crucially:** Below the description box, you will see a checkbox: **"Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace."** Check this box.
        * *First-time Publishers:* You might be prompted to accept the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement if you haven't already.
    * **Select Categories:** Choose primary and optional secondary categories that best describe your action (e.g., "Utilities," "Deployment").
    * Click **"Publish release."**

After publishing, your action will appear in the GitHub Marketplace, and other users can discover and use it in their workflows! Remember to update your action's version tag (e.g., `v2`, `v3`) and create a new release whenever you make significant changes or add new features.
